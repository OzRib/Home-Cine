# What is this?
A movie app template builded with React Native.

# What it has been built?
This app has been created to an activity in my high school.
My teacher requested the class to do an application prototype.
My idea was to make the prototype as an React Native application very sample.
It took me 3 days to build each day with 1 hour of work.
3 hours of work.
